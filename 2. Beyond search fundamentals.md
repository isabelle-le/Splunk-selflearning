PDF from page 11 to page 32. I will not rewrite all the PDF learning but only brief summary and additional learning
Key takeaway:
# 1. General search pratice to optimize your search (7 aspects)
You want your search run fast, try this step :

Time filter >>> Host/source/sourcetype >>> fields command to extract only field you need

>>> wilcards fail* (NOT f*il or *fail) >>> inclusion is better than exclusion 

>>> filter as many as possible >>> search mode (chose one in Smart, Fast, Verbose)
# 2. Tranforming command (output is a table)
Ex: top, rare, chart, time chart, stats, geostats...

Both Smart and Fast will only return a statistic results. Except Verbose mode return all 3 (Event, Patterns, Statistics). However, it is slow your search.

* Revise transforming command vs non-transforming command( look at PDF)

# 3. Job inspector and subsearch pratice (addition)
Job inspector shows you how long a given search took to run.
