# What is a transaction?
A transaction is any group of related events that span time. 

Ex: You want to see a transaction that it is contains view - addtocart- purchase happens on your website. A statistic analysis

of total view is not sufficient to your need.

# How is this work?

transaction

[<field-list>...]

[name=<transaction-name>...]

[<txn_definition-options>...]

[<memcontrol-options>...]

[<rendering-options>...]

Ex.1: transaction [<field-list>]

index=main sourcetype=access_* |transaction clientip |highlight action

returns : groupby clientip with highlight action for better viz

Ex.2: transaction [<field-list>][<txn_definition-options>...]

index=main sourcetype=access_* |transaction clientip maxspan=10m maxpause=1m startswith=view endswith=purchase

returns: with specific condition that it needs to contains view and purchase, total duration is less than 10m and each pause

between commited action is less than 1m

others txn_options: maxevents = int(like limit by in SQL); keeporphans=true( see all invalided results as well)

Ex.3: transaction [<field-list>][<txn_definition-options>...][<memcontrol-options>...]
...(like ex.2) keepevicted=true maxopenevents=2
returns: only see 2 first transactions that it is not meet specific requirement

Ex.4: transaction [<field-list>][<txn_definition-options>...][<memcontrol-options>...][<rendering-options>...]
...(like ex.2) mvraw=true delim="<<<<>>>"
returns: no space between events and seperated by <<<<>>>

Ex.5: transaction with search
index=main sourcetype=access_* |transaction clientip |search abc

Ex.6: report on transaction
index=main sourcetype=access_* |transaction clientip startswith=view endswith=purchase 

|eval duration=tostring(duration,"duration")|sort -duration |table clientip, duration, action

|timechart avg(duration)

# Transactions vs stats command? When to use what?
Use stats rather than transaction when you have a choice. Because of stats is faster and efficient. You may use transactions:

1. You have to see raw text combined rather than analysis 

2. Some field (clientip) is not sufficients to discriminate between two transactions(you need span filter...)

# Note: Example use dataset access_combined which is avaiable at tmp.zip in this dir.
