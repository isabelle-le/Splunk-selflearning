Running ML  algrs impacts the Splunk platoform perfromance costs. In order to control it, see [Splunk document](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/5.1.0/User/Configurefitandapply) for details. It is pretty clear, I just make the summary out of it.

Control file: mlspl.conf
* 2 ways to change setting : (1) Setting tab and (2) command line.
# 1. Setting tab:
MLTK >> Setting >> Choose a algr to make change >> Make change (read setting descriptions) >> Save

# 2. Make change in mlspl.conf file >> relaunch Splunk platform for setting changes to take effect.
