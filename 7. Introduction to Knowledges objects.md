# What is knowled object? 
It is tools to discover/analyse data. Splunk software knowledge is grouped into five categories:

1. Data interpretation: Fields and field extractions. 

The fields that are automatically extract from your data.

2. Data classification: Event types and transactions 

Use event types and transactions to group together interesting sets. Event types group together sets of events discovered through searches, while transactions are collections of conceptually-related events that span time.

3. Data enrichment: Lookups and workflow actions - extend your data in various ways. 

Field lookups enable you to add fields to your data. Workflow actions enable interactions between fields and other applications or web resources, such as a WHOIS lookup on a field containing an IP address. 

4. Data normalization: Tags and aliases - are used to manage and normalize sets. 

You can use tags and aliases to group sets of related field values together, and to give extracted fields tags that reflect different aspects of their identity.

5. Data models: (like schema in structure database)

representations of one or more datasets, and drive the Pivot tool. We familiar with data models since Fundamental 1.

# How to use?
They are in Splunk's web - Setting- Knowledge (9 tools)

*Example: knowledge manager (admin role) - Keeping tags straight

1. Go to Settings > Tags > List by tag name.

2. Look for tags with similar or duplicate names that belong to the same app Alternatively, you may encounter tags with identical names except for the use of capital letters, as in crash and Crash. Tags are case-sensitive. Keep in mind that you may find legitimate tag duplications

3. Try to disable or delete the duplicate or obsolete tags you find, if your permissions enable you to do so. However, be aware that there may be objects dependent on it that will be affected
