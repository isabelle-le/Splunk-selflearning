* Predictive modeling is the problem of developing a model using historical data to make a prediction on new data where we do not have the answer.
* Predictive modeling can be described as the mathematical problem of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to output variables (y). This is called the problem of function approximation.
* The job of the modeling algorithm is to find the best mapping function we can given the time and resources available.

		Classification is the task of predicting a discrete class label.
		Regression is the task of predicting a continuous quantity.

* Fundamentally, classification is about predicting a label and regression is about predicting a quantity.
