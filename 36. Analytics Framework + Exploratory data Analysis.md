# 4 ASPECTS OF ANALYTICS FRAMEWORK

## Discovery:
	- Define the problem
	- Develop a hypothesis
	- Collect and explore data

## Insights:
	- Perform data analysis

## Action:
	- Link insights to actionable recommandations
	- Excution plan

## Outcomes:
	- Review the desire outcomes of long-term objectives and solutions
	- Define the problem
	- Impacts executive decisins and employee actions

* It is always better to start from the outcomes and the hypothesis, as opposed to the available data to generate the best value from data and analytics.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 

## Sanitize & prepare data for modeling
### Dealing with missing data : 
huge % of missing data, drop it entirely. 

Other wise, rescan feature name. if it is critical, try to obtain more data.
### Label encoding : 
convert categorical text data into model-understandable numerical data

## Perform feature engineering
### Feature selection : 
select subset of relevant features in model construction, helps model accuracy, simplify model, shorten training time, reduce overfitting. 
### Feature engineering : 
creates features, helps improve model accuracy and speedup training
### Feature transformation : 
put data in a optimal format for machine learning( normalization is one example)
### Split your data into training and testing data set for ML algorithm (optional)

## Analyse & visualize data for machine learning
### Correlation :
measure the relationship between two or more variables. one changes, accompany by a change in another.
###  Scatter plot : 
None or negative(-) or positive(+) correlation. Pearson r correlation measures the degree of relationship between two linearly variables.
### Bar chart : 
compare the number of frequency of occurences for different categories. It can be stacked to show the largest catagory devided into smaller categories.
### Box plot : 
contains 50% data in the box; median value of data is a line in the box. Upper edge is 75% of data, lower edge is 25% of data
### Identify anomalies :
Standard Deviation, box plot, or use random cut forest(AWS)
